# Tunnel Manifest Scraper
This code extracts all the flyers (Guest Number & Name) from the wind tunnel's blue manifest for a given date ('YYYY-MM-DD').
An existing authenticated session must be initiated in the browser to the blue manifest before executing this program.

Originally intended to extract this data across any range of dates but the end-goal was accomplished by another means, thus haulting development for now.
